# JavaScript/CSS Challenge

> üëã Please read this document **in its entirety** first to get started!

This starter project has everything you need to begin your coding challenge. This is a two-part challenge, the first part will test your CSS knowledge and the second part will test your JavaScript and programming logic abilities.

If you do not have Git installed, you may ignore the commit instructions send the final projects.

## Challenge Instructions

You are expected to complete all tasks in [Part 1](#part-1---css) and [Part 2](#part-2---javascript) of this challenge.

Please spend 1 hour or less on this challenge. When finished, your solution must be committed and pushed back to this repository.

Note that you will need to **manually refresh** your browser window every time you add or remove code for changes to be reflected.

Your completed challenge should look and behave like evidenced in the "part-2-js.mov" video inside the co-located visual-guidelines folder.

## Part 1 - CSS

 For this portion of the exercise, you'll be working with the `index.html` file and the `styles.css` file.

* Please note that for this portion you may not add, change or remove any HTML content inside of the `body` tag of `index.html`. In fact, it shouldn't be necessary to modify anything in `index.html` for this part of the exercise.

Please add, change or remove CSS rules in a way that fulfills the following requirements:

1. Make the background of the header row of the table **pink**.
    - any shade of pink will suffice.
2. Make every odd-numbered row in the table **yellow**.
    - This does not include the header.
    - Any shade of yellow will suffice.
3. Make every even-numbered row in the table **orange**.
    - Any shade of orange will suffice

At the end of step 3, your table should look like the "part-1-css.png" picture inside the co-located visual-guidelines folder.

Please **commit** your changes to the local repository after completing this section.


## Part 2 - JavaScript

In this portion of the exercise, you'll be asked to add some programming logic to make our form work and add some features to our table. You may modify code inside of `index.html` for this portion.

Please add, change or remove code in a way that fulfills the following requirements:

1. When any of the header columns are clicked, sort the table data in the order of the clicked header.
    - E.g. If the "Age" header is clicked, the table rows should be sorted in ascending order according to the age value.
2. Add a new row to the table with the input form values when the "submit" button is clicked.
    - Form should not submit if any of the fields are empty.
3. After the form has been submitted and a new row is added into the table, the input values should be cleared to allow for a new submission.
    - Do not clear the form if a new row has not been added due to insufficient data.

At the end of step 3, your page should look and behave like evidenced in the "part-2-js.mov" video inside the co-located visual-guidelines folder.

Please **commit** your changes to the local repository after completing this section.

## Part 3 - HTML

In this portion of the exercise, you'll be asked to improve the HTML. You may modify code inside of the `index.html` `form` element for this portion.

Please add, change or remove code in a way that fulfills the following requirements:

1. All form controls must have associated labels.

Please **commit** your changes to the local repository after completing this section.

## Get started üöÄ

1. This is a frameworkless coding challenge with a single entry point, `index.html`. Please open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice.
2. Develop your solution
3. When finished:
    1. **commit** your changes to this (local) repository
    2. Zip up your completed challenge
      - Include your name in the zip file‚Äôs name
    3. Send us the completed challenge by uploading it to https://ibm.ent.box.com/f/6407c38e63a24a0c9701097ab01744d1

### Resources üîó

- In addition to the above, you can use any typical reference resource such as google, stackoverflow, mdn, etc. though remember that you'll be expected to explain and talk through your solution in depth.
- Don't use GitHub CoPilot, ChatGPT, or other AI tooling. ["52% of ChatGPT's answers contain inaccuracies and 77% are verbose"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02312).

## Wrapping up üèÅ

Once you've finished the challenge, congratulations! üéâ Be sure to **commit** your solution to this repository and send us the zipped contents. We're looking forward to seeing the solution you come up with.

During your interview you'll be expected to talk through how you approached the challenge, walk through your solution, and discuss problems you ran into. We might also come with implementation questions on alternate scenarios and discuss how you would approach them.
